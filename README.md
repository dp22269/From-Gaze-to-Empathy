## Installation and Setup <a name="installation-and-setup"></a>
### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Code Setup
- Unzip the EyeT zip using a designated function.
- Store the data locally on the machine.
- Load the data into a single CSV file.

## Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>
The data originates from the EyeT4Empathy dataset, which comprises raw eye-tracking movements and a related questionnaire.

## Preprocessing <a name="preprocessing"></a>
- Introduction of the 'gaze_distance' feature.
- Handling of missing values via imputation.
- Standardization of features.
- Division of data into training and test sets.

## Visual Analysis <a name="visual-analysis"></a>
This segment showcases a correlation matrix for the 'Gaze point X' and 'Gaze point Y' features, emphasizing their interrelationships.

## Model Analysis <a name="model-analysis"></a>
This section offers a comprehensive evaluation of each machine learning model, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and appropriate use-cases. Notably, the recently introduced 'gaze_distance' feature demonstrated significant importance in models like the Decision Tree.

## Key Takeaways and Recommendations <a name="key-takeaways-and-recommendations"></a>
- Eye movement and gaze data are potent predictors of empathy scores.
- The 'gaze_distance' feature's introduction has proven advantageous.
- Deep learning models could offer further insights.
- Amassing more diverse data might enhance model generalization.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
The project ventured to predict empathy scores using gaze and eye movement data. Through diverse machine learning models, we discerned relationships between various features and the empathy score.
